# infrasound-signal-arrival-azimuth
Matlab function that calculates the distances along a great circle and theoretical arrival times of infrasonic signals at infrasound stations of the CTBTO IMS network. It also accounts for travel times associated with various propagation channels (tropospheric, stratospheric and thermospheric). The output includes a text file with the event time, date, location, distance to station in km and degrees, estimated signal arrival times for the three propagation channels, and theoretical back azimuths for all infrasound stations. The optional output is a world map with the event and infrasound stations locations. The code works in the latest edition of Matlab (R2021a).

# infrasound-signal-arrival-azimuth-ss
Matlab function calculates the distances along a great circle and theoretical delay times of infrasonic signals (source-to-receiver) at any given location on Earth. The function is written for a single source and a single receiver. Please refer to infra_dist_azimuth.m for arrivals at all stations of the CTBTO IMS network.
